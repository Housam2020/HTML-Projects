        <p id='tribute-info'> Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi was born in Persia in 780 AD. He was a ploymath and head of the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Wisdom'> Library of Wisdom </a> in Baghdad, modern day Iraq. His major achievement was inventing algebra by being the first to complete the square in a quadratic equation. His discoveries were translated to Latin in the 12th century and gave rise to many mathematical discoveries later on, and the word 'algorithm' is derived from his name, Al-Khwarizmi. We would not be here today if not for Al-Khwarizmi.
